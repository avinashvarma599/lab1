Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 

Some of the features of the Git are like:-
 Branching and Merging 
 Small and Fast
 Distributed
 Data assurance
 Free and open source

Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

The following are the commands which we are going to use in git:-

CREATE A NEW LOCAL REPOSITORY    
git init

CHECK OUT A REPOSITORY

Create a working copy of a local repository:	
git clone /path/to/repository

For a remote server, use:	
git clone username@host:/path/to/repository

ADD FILES

Add one or more files to staging (index):	
git add <filename>
git add *

COMMIT

Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository):	
git commit -m "Commit message"

Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed sincethen:	
git commit -a

PUSH

Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository:	
git push origin master

STATUS 	

List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit:	
git status

CONNECT TO A REMOTE REPOSITORY
	
If you haven't connected your local repository to a remote server, add the server to be able to push to it:
git remote add origin <server>

List all currently configured remote repositories:	
git remote -v

BRANCHES

Create a new branch and switch to it:	
git checkout -b <branchname>

Switch from one branch to another:	
git checkout <branchname>

List all the branches in your repo, and also tell you what branch you're currently in:	
git branch

Delete the feature branch:	
git branch -d <branchname>

Push the branch to your remote repository, so others can use it:	
git push origin <branchname>

Push all branches to your remote repository:	
git push --all origin

Delete a branch on your remote repository:	
git push origin :<branchname>

UPDATE FROM THE REMOTE REPOSITORY

Fetch and merge changes on the remote server to your working directory:	
git pull

To merge a different branch into your active branch:	
git merge <branchname>

View all the merge conflicts:
git diff

View the conflicts against the base file:
git diff --base <filename>

Preview changes, before merging:
git diff <sourcebranch> <targetbranch>
	
After you have manually resolved any conflicts, you mark the changed file:	
git add <filename>
