aditi@aditi-HP-15-Notebook-PC:~/Desktop$ git push https://github.com/cps-monsoon-2015/lab1
warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

In Git 2.0, Git will default to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

Above are the commands that I used to complete the excercise 1.

-to make file we use > file name
-to edit is I used Gedit file name
-Cd is used to navigate through folders
-git init for initializing git repository
-git add for staging the changes
-git commit for committing those changes
-git log for the log
-git pull for synching the changes with the master repository and local respository.
-git push to send the changes to master repository
-rm is used to remove the unwanted files or folders
-when we first use the push command it gives an error but the error is resolved after using the pull command.
-also tried git merge and fetch command initially to avoid opening the nano editor.
