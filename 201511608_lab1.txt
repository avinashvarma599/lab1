 CASE
 
 Github is file managing that is a facility where things can be
 deposit.Git is cool took to manage file where different working on the same file,it is too
 good for developer to commuicate with other developer,where there are working on the same file.
 In Commit we save the file that we have chaned,where as in commit -m "we make comment "
 I have came to know different commands of git that is git init which make repository
 where we can deposit the things,git status to track the files,git add to add the file in stagging area,
 cd change directory,> creat any file,to select multple option we use *.(file type),
 pwd .. one level up cd <- change directory
 mkdir   creat directory/folder,which tracks all the file,pwd <- look 
 git log use to check the git save history with date,time,user name and emale.git clone use to copy,
 git push move the file,git pull take the file.This is 

The mostly used commans are
   add        We Add file  to index
   branch     List or  create or delete branch
   clone      copy new directory
   commit     save the change file
   diff       show the difference incomment
   init       Create folder or reinitialize 
   log        Show save history
   merge      merge the things
   mv         Move or rename a file or a directory,
   pull       Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push       Update remote refs along with associated objects
   rebase     Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head
   reset      Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   rm         Remove 
   show       Show all things
   status     show what i have selected
   mkdir      make a directory
   touch      creat a file
   vim        to write a text 
   :wq        write quit
